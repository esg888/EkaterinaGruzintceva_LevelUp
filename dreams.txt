I? ve learned all the lore, I? ve been told all the tales
Ancient legends of war are the wind in my sails
The deeds of the brave come alive in the rhyme
And the myth is my ship on the ocean of time
I can feel it is near, I can see it appear and at dawn on the
Glittering Heath I saw it all, gold lay beneath
And the Dragon did meet its bane and was slain and at Dawn at the
Valkyries hill, crossing the fire, acting her will
Was the slayer and how alive though it seems
I was there in my dreams
Somewhere in time deeds of the day
Became the rhymes we sing today
Where did we come from and where are we now
Is enough information to say where we? ll go Wherever we go we must go there from here
And we carry our load and we learn all the lore
I can feel it is near, I can see it appear and at dawn on the
Glittering Heath I saw it all, gold lay beneath
And the Dragon did meet its bane and was slain and at Dawn at the
Valkyries hill, crossing the fire, acting her will
Was the slayer and how alive though it seems
I was there in my dreams
Somewhere in time deeds of the day
Became the rhymes we sing today
In a way we have turned through the pages of time in a rhyme, gone back as far as we may
In a day we are part of the tales of the brave
as they pave way for descendants in dreams
Somewhere in time deeds of the day
Became the rhymes we sing today
I? ve learned all the lore
