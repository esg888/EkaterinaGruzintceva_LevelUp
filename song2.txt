Shakes the ground in agony the Lord of Lies
Once for every drop of venom in his eyes
Anger festers in his heart and loud he cries
My revenge will be the end and you will
See me rise, out of fact and fiction, Sacrifice
Raise your hands
Truth of prophecies is always in your hands
When you heed her words and do as she commands
Seals your fate and your memorial it stands
All the world ablaze Iâ€™ll set and you will
See me rise, out of fact and fiction, Sacrifice
Raise your hands for my lore and legend of these lands
Bound upon the ground until the day the sun will go away
Three winters snow falls in a row; your bonds will break from me
So you stand before the breaking of the world
Gather all your strength in vain for you will
See me rise, out of fact and fiction, Sacrifice
Raise your hands for the lore and legend of these lands,
End, it has begun, now I am free, your ending sails with me My serpent son stirs up the sea; the Ship of Nails breaks free
